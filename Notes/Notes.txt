What are we going to learn in this presentation?

- What is React?
	React is an opensource JavaScript library (NOT a framework) for building dynamic UI (User Interface)
	React is declarative. You describe what you want to achive and React does it on its own. You don't need to write the underlying stuff (which is boring)

- Initially developed by Facebook. Now maintained by Facebook, Instagram and the ReactJS community

- Why React?

	Eliminates the need to work with the DOM (What is DOM? TODO: ... ). You work with a so called "VirtualDOM" which is more easy to use and has more features in it.

- What tools are used for ReactJS development?
  - Either with Node.js and npm
  - Or simply include it in the HTML and use it there


Now for the technical part:


- React basics:
	Component
		render() - this method should return the actual UI written in JSX
		this.state - this should store the state of the component. 
			- What is the state? all the data that is visualized 

- What is JSX? 
		It's realy like Razor Syntax
